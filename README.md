# Blender Cam Rig

Blender Cam Rig is a beginner‑friendly add‑on that helps you place cameras quickly. I created it after struggling with camera placement myself, and I want it to be a simple, reliable starting point for anyone new to Blender.

## What it does
- Creates three cameras (close, medium, wide) based on your selection.
- Adds a LookAt empty and makes the cameras track it.
- Lets you snap to the selected camera with Numpad 0.

## Install (from a ZIP)
1) Download the repository as a ZIP.
2) Open Blender.
3) Go to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
4) Click **Install...** and select the ZIP you downloaded.
5) Enable the add-on by ticking the checkbox.

## Where to find it
- 3D Viewport → Sidebar (N) → **Cam Rig** tab → **Cam Rig Generator**

## How to use
1) Select one or more objects.
2) Click **Create Cam Rig**.
3) Select any of the generated cameras and press Numpad 0 to view through it.

## Requirements
- Blender 3.0 or newer.
